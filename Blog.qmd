# Delta Variant and the Limits of Quarantine Effectiveness

The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 posed a major challenge to countries that relied on strict border quarantine to prevent outbreaks. Even with high vaccination rates, the variantâ€™s higher transmissibility raised the question: **could existing quarantine systems still contain imported infections?**

This analysis revisits the study by **Zachreson et al. (2022)**, which modelled the interaction between vaccine efficacy, transmission rates, and infection-control measures within quarantine systems similar to those used in **Australia** and **New Zealand**.
