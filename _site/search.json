    "text": "I am a Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University, originally from New Delhi, India. My academic and professional journey reflects a strong interest in how data-driven thinking can shape smarter, evidence-based decisions.\nBefore beginning my master‚Äôs, I worked in the investment industry at Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, where I learned how data and analytics underpin financial strategy, portfolio management, and client insights. This experience built my appreciation for how numbers tell meaningful stories when translated effectively.\nI‚Äôm particularly passionate about transforming complex data into clear, actionable narratives through analytics and visualisation. My studies have strengthened my foundation in statistics, programming, and communication, helping me explore the full process ‚Äî from data wrangling to interpretation and presentation.\nBeyond university, I enjoy playing basketball, going to the gym, baking, and travelling. These interests keep me balanced and curious ‚Äî qualities I believe also drive thoughtful analysis and problem-solving.\n\n\n\nData & Code: R (tidyverse, ggplot2, Quarto), Python (pandas), Git/GitHub\n\nAnalysis: data visualisation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model evaluation, and reproducible pipelines\n\nCommunication: concise analytical writing, clear figure design, and stakeholder-focused reporting\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping high-quality, publication-ready reports using R and Quarto with strong documentation and cross-referencing\n\nEnhancing my ability to translate analytical findings into strategic business insights\n\nBuilding collaborative and reproducible workflows that promote transparency and team efficiency\n\n\n\n\nThis site showcases selected coursework and mini-projects from my analytics journey at Monash University. It‚Äôs an evolving space where I continue to refine my writing, visualisation style, and coding practices as I grow as an analyst."

    "text": "The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 posed a major challenge to countries that relied on strict border quarantine to prevent outbreaks. Even with high vaccination rates, the variant‚Äôs higher transmissibility raised the question: could existing quarantine systems still contain imported infections?\nThis analysis revisits the study by Zachreson et al.¬†(2022), which modelled the interaction between vaccine efficacy, transmission rates, and infection-control measures within quarantine systems similar to those used in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\nQuarantine breaches were rare before Delta, but the variant‚Äôs basic reproduction number (ùëÖ‚ÇÄ ‚âà 6‚Äì8) made containment far more difficult.\nThe key question addressed was:\nTo what extent can vaccination and infection control offset the increased transmissibility of Delta in border-quarantine environments?\n\n\n\nThe authors used simulation modelling combining two components:\n\na quarantine model for 100 travellers and 20 workers over a 14-day period with PCR testing and case isolation, and\n\na branching-process model to estimate community-outbreak probabilities from breach events.\n\nScenarios varied vaccine efficacy (0‚Äì90 %), transmissibility (ùëÖ‚ÇÄ = 3‚Äì10), and infection-control strength, allowing the study to test which combinations could maintain pre-Delta safety levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Heatmap of R‚ÇÄ and vaccine efficacy showing outbreak risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1 illustrates how higher transmissibility sharply increased outbreak risk, even at high vaccine efficacy.\n\n\nCode\n# Created a small data frame\ndelta_summary &lt;- data.frame(\n  Scenario = c(\"Base Case\", \"High Efficacy\", \"Weak Control\", \"Very High R‚ÇÄ\"),\n  `Vaccine Efficacy (%)` = c(70, 90, 70, 80),\n  `R‚ÇÄ` = c(6, 6, 6, 8),\n  `Infection Control` = c(\"Strong\", \"Strong\", \"Weak\", \"Strong\"),\n  `Relative Outbreak Risk` = c(\"Moderate\", \"Low\", \"High\", \"High\"))\n\n# Table\nkable(\n  delta_summary,\n  caption = \"Summary of simulated scenarios showing combined effects of vaccine efficacy, transmissibility, and infection control on outbreak risk.\",\n  align = \"lcccl\")\n\n\n\nSummary of simulated scenarios showing combined effects of vaccine efficacy, transmissibility, and infection control on outbreak risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario\nVaccine.Efficacy‚Ä¶.\nR.\nInfection.Control\nRelative.Outbreak.Risk\n\n\n\n\nBase Case\n70\n6\nStrong\nModerate\n\n\nHigh Efficacy\n90\n6\nStrong\nLow\n\n\nWeak Control\n70\n6\nWeak\nHigh\n\n\nVery High R‚ÇÄ\n80\n8\nStrong\nHigh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccination alone is insufficient.
