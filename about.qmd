# About Me 

I am a **Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University**, originally from **New Delhi, India**. My academic and professional journey reflects a strong interest in how data-driven thinking can shape smarter, evidence-based decisions.  

Before beginning my master’s, I worked in the **investment industry at Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC**, where I learned how data and analytics underpin financial strategy, portfolio management, and client insights. This experience built my appreciation for how numbers tell meaningful stories when translated effectively.  

I’m particularly passionate about **transforming complex data into clear, actionable narratives** through analytics and visualisation. My studies have strengthened my foundation in statistics, programming, and communication, helping me explore the full process — from data wrangling to interpretation and presentation.  

Beyond university, I enjoy **playing basketball**, **going to the gym**, **baking**, and **travelling**. These interests keep me balanced and curious — qualities I believe also drive thoughtful analysis and problem-solving.
