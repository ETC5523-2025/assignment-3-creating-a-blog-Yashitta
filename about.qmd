# About Me 

I’m a **Master of Business Analytics student at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu)**, originally from **New Delhi, India**. My journey reflects a strong interest in using data-driven thinking to make smarter, evidence-based decisions.  

I completed my undergraduate degree in **Bachelor of Commerce (Honours), specialising in Finance** from **[Gargi College, University of Delhi](https://www.gargicollege.in)**.  

Before starting my master’s, I worked in the **investment industry at [Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC](https://mutualfund.adityabirlacapital.com)**, where I learned how analytics drives financial strategy, portfolio management, and client insights. This experience deepened my appreciation for how numbers tell meaningful stories.  

I’m passionate about **turning complex data into clear, actionable insights** through analytics and visualisation. My studies have strengthened my foundation in statistics, programming, and communication, helping me understand the full process — from data wrangling to interpretation and presentation.  

Outside university, I enjoy **basketball**, **the gym**, **baking**, and **travelling** — interests that keep me balanced, curious, and creative in how I approach problem-solving.
