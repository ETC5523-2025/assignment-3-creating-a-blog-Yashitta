# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Yashitta

I am a **Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University**, originally from **New Delhi, India**. My academic and professional journey reflects a strong interest in how data-driven thinking can shape smarter, evidence-based decisions.  

Before beginning my masterâ€™s, I worked in the **investment industry at Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC**, where I learned how data and analytics underpin financial strategy, portfolio management, and client insights. This experience built my appreciation for how numbers tell meaningful stories when translated effectively.  

Iâ€™m particularly passionate about **transforming complex data into clear, actionable narratives** through analytics and visualisation. My studies have strengthened my foundation in statistics, programming, and communication, helping me explore the full process â€” from data wrangling to interpretation and presentation.  

Beyond university, I enjoy **playing basketball**, **going to the gym**, **baking**, and **travelling**. These interests keep me balanced and curious â€” qualities I believe also drive thoughtful analysis and problem-solving.  

## ðŸ§° What I Work With

- **Data & Code:** R (tidyverse, ggplot2, Quarto), Python (pandas), Git/GitHub  
- **Analysis:** data visualisation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model evaluation, and reproducible pipelines  
- **Communication:** concise analytical writing, clear figure design, and stakeholder-focused reporting  

## ðŸŽ¯ What Iâ€™m Exploring Next

- Developing **high-quality, publication-ready reports** using R and Quarto with strong documentation and cross-referencing  
- Enhancing my ability to **translate analytical findings into strategic business insights**  
- Building **collaborative and reproducible workflows** that promote transparency and team efficiency  

## ðŸ“Œ This Site

This site showcases selected coursework and mini-projects from my analytics journey at Monash University. Itâ€™s an evolving space where I continue to refine my writing, visualisation style, and coding practices as I grow as an analyst.
